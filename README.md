Please ignore the NAN, I double clicked the dividing sign so it was trying to devide with a number that doesn't exist yet.

## Notes

I had significant issues when originally building the XML file along with implementing the buttons. I am sure there is a more efficent way to do buttons but I couldn't recall it so I looked this solution up. As for the XML as a habit from HTML I used hyphens to deliminate my words in my tags and that breaks the parsing. The only other issues were a cause of not being fully familiar with Kotlin so I imagine I will get better with practice.
